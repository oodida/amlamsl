  <section id="Legacy">
    <h2>A Legacy with a Purpose</h2>
    <p>Founded on the backbone of family values and entrepreneurial spirit, Amlam SL Ltd blends deep community roots with global ambition. What began as a modest pharmacy serving local neighborhoods has grown into a dynamic, multi-division pharmaceutical company that plays a critical role in Sierra Leone’s healthcare system.</p>
    <p>Our legacy is built on trust, resilience, and a steadfast belief that quality healthcare should be accessible to all. Through every challenge and milestone, our purpose has remained unchanged—to uplift communities by ensuring consistent access to safe, affordable, and effective medicines.</p>
    <p>As we expand, we stay true to the human-centered foundation that shaped us. Our team, many of whom have grown with the company since its earliest days, embodies the values of integrity, accountability, and compassion. Their dedication is more than professional—it’s personal.</p>
    <p>Today, Amlam SL Ltd stands at the intersection of tradition and transformation. While our past is marked by hard work and generational leadership, our future is defined by innovation, scalability, and an unwavering commitment to healthcare excellence. We are investing in cutting-edge systems, forging new global partnerships, and exploring fresh market opportunities—not just for growth, but to drive lasting impact across Sierra Leone and the African continent.</p>
    <p>With every step forward, we honor our legacy while pursuing a healthier, more equitable future for all.</p>
